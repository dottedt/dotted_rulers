# DottedRulers

  Rebuilding Rails: Get Your Hands Dirty and Build Your Own Ruby Web Framework
  [Rubuilding Rails](http://rebuilding-rails.com/)

## Notes
  This tutorial/book could do for a update.  Several issues will have you looking up unexpected errors/changes since it was written.
  This could account for the numerous unfinished/nonworking rulers projects on github that I found.
  In the end I found that even the authors finished project no longer works.

  That's not to say you wont find any value in going through the book and exercises.  You will but be prepared for things not to work as presented in the book.  Also the style for code examples is a bit inconsistent in my opinion.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'dotted_rulers'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install dotted_rulers

## Usage

  Just an example application for getting to know how Rails works under the covers.  DON'T USE THIS THE CODE NO LONGER WORKS.
